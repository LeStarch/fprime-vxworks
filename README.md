# Set up
Make sure to add the following to your project's `settings.ini` file:

1. Add the path to `fprime-vxworks` to `library_locations`
2. Add to `default_cmake_options` the following where `FPRIME_PLATFORM` is assigned to your selected platform (`VxWorks-Posix` in this case)
   ```cmake
   VX_TARGET_TYPE=DKM
   FPRIME_PLATFORM=VxWorks-Posix
   ```
3. Define `WIND_CC_SYSROOT` in the `environment` section. This variable should point to your project's VxWorks Source Build (VSB).

> NOTE: `VX_TARGET_TYPE`, `FPRIME_PLATFORM`, and `WIND_CC_SYSROOT` are required definitions by this VxWorks toolchain. 

# Example settings.ini
This is an example for a project's `settings.ini` file that uses fprime-vxworks for POSIX.
